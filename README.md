## What the game is about

The game is a simple matching the cards style game. They're 16 cards always randomized in different locations for every game.

## How to play the game

There are 8 different styles of cards and you have to match the similar card together.
Clicking on 2 different cards will increase your move count.
If you finish the game in less than 14 moves you get 3 stars, if you finish in less than 19 you'll get 2 stars, and if you get more than 19 moves you'll get 1 star.
When you match all 16 cards you'll get a victory alert and will give you an option to play again.
