## What the game is about

The game is a simple matching the cards style game. They're 16 cards always randomized in different locations for every game.

## How to play the game

There are 8 different styles of cards and you have to match the similar card together.
Clicking on 2 different cards will increase your move count.
If you finish the game in less than 14 moves you get 3 stars, if you finish in less than 19 you'll get 2 stars, and if you get more than 19 moves you'll get 1 star.
When you match all 16 cards you'll get a victory alert and will give you an option to play again.

## How to download and install game

This file is not on gitHub but it would be as easy as downloading the whole file and unzipping it. After that double click index.html and the game will run.

Looked up how to disable an element on w3schools.com

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
